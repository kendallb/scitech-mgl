This is to announce the release of svgalib 1.3.0. It has been uploaded to
the incoming dirs of sunsite and tsx and will appear in the appropriate dirs
(see LSM below) and on their mirrors after a (hopefully) short delay.

Caveats since 1.2.13:
 - The environment variable GSVGAMODE was renamed to SVGALIB_DEFAULT_MODE
 - All MOUSE_* environment variables were removed.
 - MAX_REGS was changed. This means that you MAY NO LONGER use old VGA
   state files created with restoretextmode. Simply recreated them with
   the new version of restoretextmode and you should be fine.

Major New features since 1.2.13:
 - Reads ~/.svgalibrc & where SVGALIB_CONFIG_FILE points.
 - Logarithmic Mouse Acceleration & Mouse event emulation on raw keyboards
   all configurable from a file.
 - Added apm driver for AT3D.
 - Added nv3 driver for Riva128.
 - Added ET6000 driver.
 - Mouse acceleration/override can be configured from config file.
 - Added joystick support.
 - Added Microsoft IntelliMouse/Logitech MouseMan+ support.
 - Faking keyboard presses on Mousewheel turns.
 - Added a Vesa driver: NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE:
   This does not mean that all so called 'vesa' cards now work as Joe
   Blow User seems to think, this is just too difficult if not impossible.
   You might need a decent kernel (I think 2.0.32 was reported working) and
   nicely behaved card with a VESA bios extension in ROM. Right now, only
   one of three (namely STB Velocity 128, AT25 and CL-5446 don't)
   works.
 - There seems to be a need for 512x384 mode timings. It is difficult to add
   these for cards where predefined mode timings have to be dumped from the
   card or bios. For those drivers flexible enough to set own timings, such
   an example timing was added to the 'demo' libvga.config

Major fixes since 1.2.13:
 - Makefile fixes.
 - Mach32 calculation of monitor limits in interlace modes.

NOTE: There were some preversions of 1.3.0 floating through the net already,
this, however, is the 'official' version. Finally, although the maintainer
will try to answer any emails, it is appreciated when you mail/join the
mailing list linux-svgalib@vger.rutgers.edu (mail a msg 'help' to
Majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu for details on subscription) instead. I'll read
any mail there too but the discussion/answer can be discussed by many
people and I don't have to write the same mail every one or two days to
different people.
